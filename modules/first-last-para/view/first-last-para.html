	<p>From the outside, working at a zoo might not seem like a daunting career: feed the animals, clean up after the animals, don’t let the lions eat the zebras. But in reality, the responsibility of not only housing living creatures to adequate standards but often ensuring the protection of entire species is at stake, especially when you’re the world famous San Diego Zoo..</p>
	<p >Admittedly, there are zoos, traveling animal shows, and other live-creature venues that create sub-par and even abusive conditions for their residents. But the nearly 100-year-old San Diego Zoo–actually founded after animals from the Panama-California Exposition were abandoned following the event–has long been regarded as the gold standard for not only the entertainment value of zoo exhibits, but for the preservation, study, and standards of caring for animals of any species.</p>
	<p >The zoo pioneered the concept of the “cageless” enclosure, as well as employees with conservationists and researchers to protect the entire species of each of its residents, not just the individual animals represented at the zoo.</p>
